## :point_right: Sinartra + Ruby Starter Repo
Basically, you clone it and it serves a starter for any ruby sinartra app. I find it useful becuase I am always building simple sinatra apps and I end up setting up the same files repeatedly; in other words, this repo should save you a couple of minutes.

## :point_right: Usage / Short description of project
1. Clone with `git clone https://github.com/omarsar/ruby_starter.git`
2. Add your gems or libraries here `Gemfile` 
3. Add your configurations here `/config/config_env.rb
4. Revise your procfile `Procfile`
5. Create your main app here `app.rb`
6. Setup app to run here `config.ru`
7. You can change your helper function here `/helpers/helper.rb`
8. Your app's public assets go here `/public/`
9. Depending of what you are using for templating / layouts, they go here `/views/
10. Finally, run `rackup` in root directory of your app

## :point_right: Additional commands for pushing to Github
